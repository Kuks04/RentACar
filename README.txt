My goal
In this project, I aimed to showcase my skills in PHP and MySQL. The idea behind it was to create a platform where clients could rent vehicles through a website. On the website, I implemented authentication and authorization, worked with sessions and cookies, and utilized CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Functionality
I allowed users to make reservations and provided a feature for password recovery, where they could request a verification code sent to their email address if they forgot their password. Furthermore, users had the flexibility to modify their personal information and upload a profile picture. Additionally, admins have been given options that allow them to add new vehicles and send newsletters to registered users via email.

Summary
This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in PHP and MySQL but also highlighted my ability to develop a full-fledged web application that meets the needs of both clients and administrators. It involved a range of features aimed at enhancing user experience, security, and ease of management.
